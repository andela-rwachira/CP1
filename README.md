CheckPoint1 - Room Allocation System

This is a command line application which models a room allocation system for one of Andelaâ€™s facilities called Amity.

Amity has rooms which can be offices or living spaces. An office can occupy a maximum of 6 people. A living space can inhabit a maximum of 4 people.

A person to be allocated could be a fellow or staff. Staff cannot be allocated living spaces. Fellows have a choice to choose a living space or not.

This system will be used to automatically allocate spaces to people at random.

You can use the application to do the following:

1. create_room <room_name>... - Creates rooms in Amity. Create as many rooms as possible by specifying multiple room names after the create_room command.

2. add_person <person_name> <FELLOW|STAFF> [wants_accommodation] - Adds a person to the system and allocates the person to a random room. wants_accommodation here is an optional argument which can be either yes or no. The default value if it is not provided is no.

3. reallocate_person <person_identifier> <new_room_name> - Reallocate the person with person_name to new_room_name.

4. load_people - Adds people to rooms from a txt file. See Appendix 1A for text input format.

5. print_allocations [-o=filename]  - Prints a list of allocations onto the screen. Specifying the optional   -o option here outputs the registered allocations to a txt file. See Appendix 2A for format.

6. print_unallocated [-o=filename] - Prints a list of unallocated people to the screen. Specifying the -o option here outputs the information to the txt file provided.

7. print_room <room_name> - Prints  the names of all the people in room_name on the screen.

8. save_state [--db=sqlite_database] - Persists all the data stored in the app to a SQLite database. Specifying the --db parameter explicitly stores the data in the sqlite_database specified.

9. load_state <sqlite_database> - Loads data from a database into the application.
